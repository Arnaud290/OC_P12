# PROJECT 12: Develop a secure back-end architecture using Django ORM

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++

## Context

Create a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) API with Django REST Framwork and PostgreSQL using an entity-relationship diagram. Access to the database must be secured. A Django administration interface must also be created.


## Installation

### 1 - Installation of PostgreSQL and packages for psycopg2 driver (on Linux UBUNTU)

    sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-client libpq-dev python3-dev build-essential python3-psycopg2

    sudo systemctl enable --now postgresql

    at /etc/postgresql/{postgreSQL_version}/main/postgresql.conf
    delete # before " listen_addresses "
    update " listen_addresses = '127.0.0.1' " (for localhost or another client address)

    
    sudo systemctl restart postgresql

    update admin password :

        sudo su - postgres

        $ psql -c "ALTER USER postgres WITH password 'newpassword'"

    create database user : 

        $ psql -c "CREATE USER adminbdd WITH password 'userdbpassword'"

    create new database :

        $ createdb epiceventsdb -O adminbdd    


### 2 - Installation of Python3, the virtual environment tool, the package manager and git (on Linux UBUNTU)

    $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv python3-pip git


### 3 - Clone project

    git clone https://github.com/Arnaud290/OC_P12.git

### 4 - Setting up the virtual environment "env"

    1 - Access to the project directory:
            
            $ cd OC_P12/

    2 - Creation of the virtual environment:
            
            $ python3 -m venv env


### 5 - Opening the virtual environment and adding modules

            $ source env/bin/activate
            
            (env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt


### 6 - Modification of the file settings_example.py

    (env) $ cd OC_P12/epiceventscrm/epiceventscrm/

    1 - Rename the settings_example.py file to settings.py

        (env) $ mv settings_exemple.py settings.py

    2 - In the settings.py file:

            modify the variable 'SECRET_KEY' in order to add a security key
            "django-insecure- (+ 50 random characters with uppercase,
            lowercase, numbers and special characters)

            in DATABASES :
            update password
            'PASSWORD': 'password_adminbdd',
        

### 7 - Migrate database and restaure dump db
            
            (env) $ cd OC_P12/epiceventscrm/
            (env) $ ./manage.py migrate
            sudo su
            su postgres 
            # cd OC_P12/epiceventscrm/db_file/
            # pg_restore --clean --dbname epiceventsdb epiceventsdb.dump

            if you want dump database: 

                # pg_dump --format=custom --file epiceventsdb.dump epiceventsdb


## Using the program


### 1 - Launch

    Launching the Django server

    (env) $ cd OC_P12/epiceventscrm/
    (env) $ ./manage.py runserver


### 2 - Using the CRM

    In order to test this CRM, 5 fictitious users are registered with some projects,
    problems and comments in the "db.sqlite3" database made available in the repository:

        - admin     > Manager user

        - franÃ§ois  > Commmercial user
        - marc      > Commercial user

        - sylvain   > Support user
        - sophie    > Support user 

        the password for users: P@ssword1

    Access to the admin page :

        Example on a local installation:    http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin                 > Admin page
                                            http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/log_viewer/     > Console log page

        user: admin
        password: P@ssword1

        Command for creating an administrator:

            (env) $ cd OC_P12/epiceventscrm/
            (env) $ ./manage.py createsuperuser

    Section of the admin page :

### 3 - Using queries

    Several methods exist to perform queries, example:

        - With POSTMAN software (Used for the documentation of this CRM)

                Installation on Linux UBUNTU:

                sudo snap install postman

        - With the command line software cURL:

            Installation on Linux UBUNTU:

                sudo snap install curl

            Example of the 'GET contract' request

                curl --location --request GET 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/contract' \
                --header 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN_ACCESS'
